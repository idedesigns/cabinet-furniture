On the other side, medium density fibreboard (mdf), is an engineered wood product through a combination of several wood fibers with the use of a resin or a wax binder from high pressure. As a noun fibreboard is (british|canada) a material made from wood chips or shavings, which are compressed and bonded with resin and formed into stiff. For interior and exterior strength, plywood is the best. While particleboard and mdf are a part of the same composite board and fiberboard product family, there are some important differences to keep in mind.
