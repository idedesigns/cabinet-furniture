Reverend Robert Naylor Funeral Details From funeraldirector.co.uk
As of 2014, payment to pastors for conducting funerals can range from nothing to a few hundred dollars, depending on the pastor&#39;s personal choices and those of his church. However, if funerals are held in a church during mass there will likely be additional honorarium payment. Honorariums vary from $50 to more than $500, depending on the family’s resources and on the specific services provided by the pastor. You want to show your gratitude and appreciation for the time and effort the minister.
